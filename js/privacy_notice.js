        activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</span>

      information in the following situations:</p>
    <li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <p data-custom-class="privacy__heading_2" id="intltransfers">4. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?

    <p><em><strong>In Short: </strong>We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than
        your own.</em></p>
    <p>
      Our servers are located in Erathia. If you are accessing our Website from outside , please be aware that your
      information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties
      with whom we may share your personal information (see "<a data-custom-class="privacy__link" href="#infoshare">
        WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</a>" above), in and other countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection
      laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures
      to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.
    </p>
    <p data-custom-class="privacy__heading_2" id="inforetain">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

    <p><em><strong>In Short: </strong>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined
        in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
      privacy
      notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
      requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
      stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
      processing until deletion is possible.
    </p>
    <p data-custom-class="privacy__heading_2" id="infosafe">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

    <p><em><strong>In Short: </strong>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational
        and technical security measures.</em></p>
    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of
      any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
      electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure,
      so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be
      able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will
      do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website
      is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.
    </p>

    <p data-custom-class="privacy__heading_2" id="privacyrights">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

    <p><em><strong>In Short: </strong>You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>

    <p>
      If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
      information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find
      their contact details here: <a data-custom-class="privacy__link"
        href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm"

    </p>

    <p data-custom-class="privacy__heading_2" id="DNT">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature
      or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
      activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
      DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
      that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
      notice.
    </p>
